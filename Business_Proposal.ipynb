It will help people making smart and efficient decision on selecting great neighborhood out of numbers of other neighborhoods in North York, Toronto.\n\nLots of people are migrating to various states of Canada and needed lots of research for good housing prices and reputated schools for their children. This project is for those people who are looking for better neighborhoods. For ease of accessing to Cafe, School, Super market, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospital, like minded people, etc.\n\nThis Project aim to create an analysis of features for a people migrating to North York to search a best neighborhood as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. The features include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for emergency, water resources both freash and waste water and excrement conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities.\n\nIt will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work or to start a new fresh life."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Project Purpose:"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The major purpose of this project, is to suggest a better neighborhood in a new city for the person who are moving there.
